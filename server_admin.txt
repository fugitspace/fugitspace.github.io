Recently, my friend had just setup a cloud instance running Ubuntu, and all of a sudden he saw different
URLs being accessed from his server, and several unknown files listed.
I used not to be so much involved with this because for all the previous projects, there was always someone 
taking care of Server Administration. I felt useless to this friend, all I could do was provide some ideas
on what he can do, mentioning technologies that I have heard of or I have used occasionally in the past.

here is a short list of technologies that I have used for server security
1. Use of RSA keys for authentication. never user the password
2. Using fail2ban, a great daemon tool that monitors login attempts.
The great advantage of fail2ban is that it blocks any activity that seems suspious, hence
the need for the key authentication.


You will most likely have a ~/.ssh directory. secure it with 700 mode and then create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
make yourself the owner of the this file.

stop login from ssh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
add the following

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers username@[ip_addr] username@[ip_addr]

you may want to restart ssh service


setup a firewall.

Ubuntu comes with ufw.
to configure it to only open certain ports, running
ufw allow from [ip_addr] to any port # to allow ssh for you only
ufw allow 80 # for http
ufw allow 443 # for https
ufw enable # so enable the firewall
