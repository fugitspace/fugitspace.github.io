SO, I got this Dell Latitude 7480 with 8GB memory, Intel Core i5 (quad-core), 256GB SSD.
Its performance was superb when I first installed Ubuntu.
I had issues with resolution at first, however through some tweaks I managed to get it configured 
to my liking.
However something was always bothering me. Always, at the middle of doing something great, my CPU fan
would start making this loud noise, meaning it was overheating. This happened in most cases when I opened
some websites on Google Chrome. Closing these sites would resolve the issue, well at least temporarily until 
I opened that website again.
